# Kinsta - Hello World - Scala
An example of how to set your Scala application up to enable deployment on Kinsta App Hosting services.

> Kinstaâ€™s Application Hosting is a service to run your web apps and any databases side by side in a hassle-free 
environment, tailored for developer needs and ease of use. App Hosting is currently in an invite-only beta phase, 
sign up for a test account at [kinsta.com/app-hosting](https://kinsta.com/app-hosting).

## Dependency Management
During the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `build.sbt` file.

## Web Server Setup

### Port
Kinsta automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. You should **not** define it yourself and you should 
**not** hard-code it into the application. Use `scala.util.Properties.envOrElse("PORT", "8080")` in your code when referring to the server port. 

### Start Command
When deploying an application Kinsta will automatically create a web process with the built executable as the entry point.
